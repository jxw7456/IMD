Homework Project 2 - Asteroids

User Functionality:
 - Arrow Keys (or WASD keys) to create movement and rotation for the spaceship
 - Spacebar to shoot bullets from the face of the spaceship
 - F3 to start and restart game

Reasoning for design choices:
This project utilizes vectors, random number generators, and collision detection as the primary concepts 
to creating an Asteroids-type game scene.

Above and Beyond:
For this project, I provided three separate game states: MENU, GAME, and GAMEOVER. Furthermore, when the 
player wins (destroys all asteroids), the text "You Win" appears. Lastly, I added a outerspace feel background music.

Requirements not completed:
All requirements were completed.
